# OliverVocabulary

Oliver's Vocabulary Game is a tool created by my son. He wanted to have a robot that talks and accept answer similar to Alexa.

This tool allows kids between 10+ years old to practice vocabulary and use azure speech API to interpret the answer and reviewed by OpenAI.

Any correct answers are praised with a start and wrong answer are responded with the correct answer and ask to try again, so give it a go and allow your kid to play around with vocabulary in my son case it's about 11+ exam and a fun way to learn.
